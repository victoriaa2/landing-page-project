        <strong>Rachel Ama</strong> delivers an enticing collection of batch-cooked vegan meals that aims
        to make ‚Äúplant-based eating feel more achievable (and delicious).‚Äù The core recipes‚Äîmany of which are inspired
        by
        the author‚Äôs Caribbean roots‚Äîare prepared in one pot, pan, or tray. For each, she provides three different ways
        to
        transform the recipe into a different dish. After introducing the harissa hot pot with eggplants and chickpeas,
        for instance,she revamps the dish by adding it to garlic, lemon, and kale wild rice, then to toasted garlic
        sourdough with arugula, and finally to an herby green tahini and green bean salad. Another notable core recipe
        is
        her cuban black beans, which she repurposes in a white rice seasoned with lime and cilantro, a cuban black bean
        tortilla salad bowl, and fajitas with salsa and guacamole. Sweeter options make an appearance as well: after
        preparing stewed berries, home cooks can then use them to create a cobbler, mixed berry chia jam, and a no-bake
        berry coconut cake. Made with easily accessible ingredients, the recipes are simple to follow, especially for
        novice vegan home cooks. Those looking to expand their plant-based repertoires with a flavor-packed punch will
        find Ama‚Äôs guide a veritable treat.

        Create a veg-packed centrepiece dish in one pan/pot/tray and choose from three creative and flavoursome ways to
        either
        serve it up with just a few ingredients or transform it into something else entirely. Scale portions up or down,
        cook
        all three serving options for a vegan feast with friends, or freeze leftovers to refresh
        later when you're strapped for time - whatever you choose, this way of cooking will help you have dinner
        part-ready-and-waiting, making plant-based eating feel even more achievable every day.

      <p>
        London Youtuber and vegan chef <strong>Rachel Ama</strong> is the author of the popular plant-based cookbook
        <em>One Pot: Three Ways.</em>
        Rachel creates her recipes by moving through ‚Äòstations‚Äô in the kitchen, weaving together fresh ingredients,
        pantry
        staples, and, most importantly, the ‚Äòflavour station‚Äô, where she adds spices, dried herbs and those
        all-important
        sauces to really bring each dish to life. Rachel Ama turned vegan seven years ago and her simple recipes which
        fit
        into a busy schedule have been making waves among the London vegan community.
